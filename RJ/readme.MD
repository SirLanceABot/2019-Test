TODO
CameraFrame should be updated to be like Images or maybe it is exacly the same so no need for it.
It rpobably isn't referenced at this time.

Currently the camera process and pipeline process in-line the functions of camera frame (like images) within a synchronized block.

Could remove the synchronized blocks - maybe - needs analysis.
